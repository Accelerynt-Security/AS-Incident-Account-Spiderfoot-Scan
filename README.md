# AS-Incident-Spiderfoot-Scan

Author: Accelerynt

For any technical questions, please contact info@accelerynt.com  

This playbook is intended to be run from a Microsoft Sentinel incident. It will pull email addresses from the account entities in an incident and use them as targets in a Spiderfoot scan. By default, the scan is created using the HaveIBeenPwned module. The resulting report of that scan will be emailed to a recipient specified upon deployment.

#
### Requirements

The following items are required under the template settings during deployment: 

* The unique subdomain of your Spiderfoot account
* Your Spiderfoot API key
* The email address you would like to have the completed Spiderfoot report link sent to

# 
### Setup

#### Spiderfoot Subdomain
 
Once you have logged into your Spiderfoot account, take note of your unique subdomain, as it is needed to make API calls. This would be "**example**" in "**example.hx.spiderfoot.net**".

#### Spiderfoot API Key
 
 Log into your Spiderfoot account and in the top right-hand corner under your name, click the "**API Key**" option.
